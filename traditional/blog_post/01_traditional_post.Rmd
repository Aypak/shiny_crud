# Introduction

**NOTE:** This post is intended for users comfortable with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com), and at the very least familiar with DBMS's (here, [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org)), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com), & [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

## Overview

In this blog post, I'll discuss how to create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using R's Shiny framework & a local SQLite3 database file. This same application can be made with other DBMS's with very few changes. Additionally, this app has a heavy focus on utilizing application [modularization](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html).

## Data

For this application, we use the well-known [mtcars](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html) dataset, applying some data preparation (saved as `data_prep.R` in the `data_prep` directory) to the data before saving the transformed data as an RDS file in the `data_prep/prepped/` directory. For example, the mtcars dataset uses the `model` of the car as the rownames of the dataframe, so we convert these to a column named `model` by using the `rownames_to_column()` function.

Then, in `db_init.R` (also in the `data_prep` directory), we use the [`RSQLite`](https://rsqlite.r-dbi.org/) package to create a connection object with the local `SQLite` database, or file, creating a new `.sqlite3` file if one doesn't already exist. Initially, we write an empty table specifying the column names & value types. We loop through the transformed data, creating our own unique `uid` values by applying a hash function with the `digest()` function to each row of the data. These values are added to the transformed dataset as the `Primary Key` in the 1st column, named `uid`. Finally, we write the data to the `.sqlite3` file, named `mtcars.sqlite3` in the `shiny_app/data/` directory.

## Application Structure

As you may know, Shiny applications are able to handle a few different structures. Our applications always include 3 files placed in the `shiny_app` directory:

* `global.R`
  + `library()` in all necessary packages
  + Create a database connection with `mtcars.sqlite3` file
  + Apply any other global options here
* `ui.R`
  + Main UI portion of application
  + Apply UI from modules (discussed more in the **Modules** section)
* `server.R`
  + Main server portion of application
  + Use `callModule()` to call server portion of modules

A Shiny app with this structure can be run by opening any 3 of these files, and pressing the `Run App` button in RStudio. 

# Modules

## Overview

One of the features included in the most recent update for `Shiny`, which we utilize for our modules, is the `R` directory. Any *R scripts* in the `shiny_app/R` directory are automatically sourced in by the app. Therefore, we place all of our module files in this directory so that they're automatically sourced into the app, whereas before we had to explicity source in each module file using the `source()` function.

## Cars Table Module

Of the 3 modules used in our app, this is the only module file (`cars_table_module.R`) that follows the typical module structure. That is, it contains a **UI** portion & a **server** portion. At the beginning of these code portions, we include [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) formatted documentation that explains the purpose of the module, the packages (& respective functions) included, the additional argument parameters (i.e. Anything besides **id** for the ui portion, or anything besides **input**, **output**, & **session** for the server portion), and what the module returns (if anything).

### High-Level Description

At a high level, the CRUD application's car_table module along with two nested modules(i.e. car_delete and car_edit) provide the backbone for the application. These modules interact with a local SQLite3 database.

Within the `cars_table_module`, the primary UI displays an action button to "add car" and a DT Ouptut to display the table of car data. Within the car table, a seperate function is called(i.e. cars_table_module_js) which is used to add the javascript necessary to construct an edit and delete button which is present in the leftmost column.

### UI Portion

The **UI** portion (e.g. function) of this module is given the same name as the module's filename, but with `_ui` appended to the end. This particular UI portion has only 1 parameter, `id`, the default required parameter. You'll see that the 1st line of this portion includes `ns <- NS(id)`. This is required for any inputs/outputs used within the modules. This allows for the same modules to be reused for different purposes by applying a different `id` when calling the `module_ui(id)` function 

## Car Edit Module

The "Add" button at the top of the page and the "Edit" button contained within the first column both call upon the car_edit_module for their functionality.  This module displays a 'modal" or pop up box with numeric and text input fields.  This modal is what accepts user input to "Edit" or "Add" to the car table.  When the "Submit" button at the lower right corner of the "modal" is pressed, the application creates a list with the modal selections and a unique 'uid" to identify the row.  After validation, the app generates the requisite SQL commands to insert or edit row into the database.  

## Car Delete Module

The delete module is called upon when the "Delete" button(red trashcan) is clicked.  This module is simpler in its functionality and simply displays a "modal" that asks if the user is sure they want to delete this row as well as two button options("Delete Car" and "Cancel").  When the "Delete Car" button is selected the SQL command is generated which deletes the desired row.
