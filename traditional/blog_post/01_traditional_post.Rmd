**NOTE:** This post is intended for users comfortable with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com), and at the very least familiar with DBMS's (here, [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org)), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com), & [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
